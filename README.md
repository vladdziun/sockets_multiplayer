# node_sockets

This is a hackathon project (5 hrs)
The purpose of this hackathon was to explore the functionality of sockets. We were suppose to learn how sockets 
worked in nodejs and implement some kind of project. We chose to create a room where users can log in and
move a character around. Once people start up a server anyone should be abld eto log in and have a character to move around
all in the same room. We were able to acomplish this. 

Up until initial commit is the original hackathon project. We are still planning to add additonal functionality and interaction 
among users who log in.

Planned Features:

customize the ninja characters that people are assigned
create some interaction between players
gamify the project so there is some winable goal for users to work toward once logged in
